When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

 In a team work, working in the same project, each of the member of the team can focus in a specific 
task with the end of build faster the project 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

and pull them according to your interest at that time

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?

 The diference is, when you forking, you make a copy inside the website(GitHub) that keeps a track from the original and you clone
 when you make a copy from the website(GitHub) to your local machine, you use the first one to get a project to your account on GitHub
 and the second one to copy that project to you computer and the branches are changes made by team working in the project, that allows 
 you to keep track of previous versions of the project 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
